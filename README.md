2. Numply
3. 𝖯𝖺𝗇𝖽𝖺𝗌
4. 𝖬𝖺𝗍𝗉𝗅𝗈𝗍𝗅𝗂𝖻
5. 𝖲𝖾𝖺𝖻𝗈𝗋𝗇

Projects Highlights:
𝟏)𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Delved deep into sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights.
𝟐)𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘆: Leveraged Python and essential libraries for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
𝟑)𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴: Crafted compelling visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
𝟒)𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁: Explored how Diwali promotions influenced sales, identifying growth opportunities.
𝟓)𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀: Applied statistical techniques to validate trends and draw meaningful conclusions.


 Learnings:
1. Conducted data cleaning and manipulation procedures.
2. Utilized Python libraries for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Enhanced customer experience by pinpointing potential customers within 
various states, occupations, genders, and age groups.
4. Boosted sales through the identification of top-selling product categories and individual products, facilitating improved inventory planning to meet demand effectively.

#Conclusion: Married women age group 26-35 yrs from UP, Maharastra, and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.
